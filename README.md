## Introduction

The LangChain Library is an open-source Python library designed to simplify and accelerate the development of natural language processing applications. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, these tutorials will walk you through the basics of using LangChain to process and analyze text data effectively.

## Installation

Before diving into the tutorials, make sure you have installed the LangChain and OpenAI Libraries. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install langchain openai
```

Please refer to the official [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) for more detailed installation instructions and library features.

Depending on the tutorial you run, you may need to install the following libraries:

- `python-dotenv`: Used to read the .env file containing the OpenAI API Key
- `ipykernel`: Enables running this notebook in VSCode
- `youtube-transcript-api`: Fetches YouTube video transcripts
- `pytube`: Fetches YouTube video metadata
- `tiktoken`: Counts tokens in a text


## Getting Started

If you are new to LangChain, we recommend starting with the `Getting Started` section of the documentation. There, you will learn the fundamentals of the library and the basic concepts required for the tutorials.

## Tutorials

The tutorials in this repository cover a range of topics and use cases to demonstrate how to use LangChain for various natural language processing tasks. Each tutorial is contained in a separate Jupyter Notebook for easy viewing and execution.
